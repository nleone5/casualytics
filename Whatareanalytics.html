                <p>Statistics and Analytics in order of Complexity:</p>
                <li>Standard - Hits(2B, 3B, HR), Runs-Batted-In, Runs, Stolen Bases, Base-on-Balls, Strikeouts</li>
                <li>Intermediate - Batting Average, On-Base-Percentage, Slugging Percentage, OPS.</li>

<article>
<p>Percentage Statistics are a way to measure a player's performance in a more accurate way than just counting the number of hits, runs, etc. they have</p>
<p>These statistics are calculated by dividing the number of times a player does something by the number of times they have the opportunity to do it</p>
